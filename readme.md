<h1><center>Snakes</center></h1>
<hr />
<p>
A <b>Retro</b> Themed Classical Snakes game Which Has some more improved Features
such as
<br />
<ol>
<li>Bonus Food for Speed up.( evil food )<br/>
Increases Speed of the Snake, hence increasing the difficulty <br/>
level for the player for some time.
</li>
<li>Invisibility Bonus ( evil food ) <br/>
On picking up this food, the whole arena blacks out , leaving the<br/>
snake stranded in a dark evil scenario with nothing but its head visible<br/>
to the player, its now only based on the player's memory<br/>
of the position of mazes, for him to guide it.Cant be more evil rite ?<br/>
Dont worry, if the snake survives for a few moments it will escape it <br/>
and come back to the normal world.
</li>
<li>Magnet Bonus ( awesome food )<br/>
Yes, You become a food magnet, just go near a food, if you are in<br/>
a certain vicinity of the food, its taken up.But dont be too excited<br/>
its just for some time.
