<h1><center>Snakes</center></h1>

<p>
A Retro Themed Classical Snakes game Which Has some more improved Features
such as

1)Bonus Food for Speed up.( evil food )
Increases Speed of the Snake, hence increasing the difficulty 
level for the player for some time.

2)Invisibility Bonus ( evil food ) 
On picking up this food, the whole arena blacks out , leaving the
snake stranded in a dark evil scenario with nothing but its head visible
to the player, its now only based on the player's memory
of the position of mazes, for him to guide it.Cant be more evil rite ?
Dont worry, if the snake survives for a few moments it will escape it 
and come back to the normal world.

3)Magnet Bonus ( awesome food )
Yes, You become a food magnet, just go near a food, if you are in
a certain vicinity of the food, its taken up.But dont be too excited
its just for some time.

4)Food Rain ( awesome food )
Just like mario's Bonus round, here we have a bonus food rain,
Eat em ALL

And other rules follow
1) Dont hit the walls ( seriously ?? isnt that obvious ? )

2) To play use arrow keys up down left right ( duhh )

3) 50 points for normal food

4) 200 points for Bonus food
