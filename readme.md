such as
<br />
<ol>
<li>Bonus Food for Speed up.( evil food )<br/>
Increases Speed of the Snake, hence increasing the difficulty <br/>
level for the player for some time.
</li>
<li>Invisibility Bonus ( evil food ) <br/>
On picking up this food, the whole arena blacks out , leaving the<br/>
snake stranded in a dark evil scenario with nothing but its head visible<br/>
to the player, its now only based on the player's memory<br/>
of the position of mazes, for him to guide it.Cant be more evil rite ?<br/>
Dont worry, if the snake survives for a few moments it will escape it <br/>
and come back to the normal world.
